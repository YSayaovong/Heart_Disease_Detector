# Heart Disease Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at classifying whether or not a patient has heart disease based on certain health metrics. Using data science techniques, this analysis examines patient data and explores features correlated with heart disease, ultimately building a classification model to predict heart disease presence.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is stored in the file `heart-disease.csv`. This dataset contains several patient records with features potentially relevant to the presence of heart disease.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading**: The dataset is imported and initially explored to understand its structure and features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes cleaning and transformation to prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training**: Multiple machine learning models are evaluated to classify patients with and without heart disease.
- **Evaluation**: The model performance is assessed using various metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
