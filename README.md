# Heart Disease Detector

This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning classification model to predict the presence of heart disease based on a patient's health metrics and heart measurements.

## Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for heart disease detection. Using health parameters and specific heart measurements, the model classifies whether a patient is likely to have heart disease, assisting healthcare providers in early diagnosis.

## Data

The model is trained using a dataset containing various patient health parameters, including:

- Age
- Gender
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- Electrocardiographic results
- Heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression

The dataset should be in CSV format and organized to match these parameters for successful model training.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Heart-Disease-Detector.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Detector

## Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Data Exploration: Use Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore and visualize the dataset.

Model Training: Run main.py to preprocess data and train the machine learning model.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in new patient data. To test, provide input data in a similar format to the training dataset.

## Model
The classification model utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression or random forest, to achieve optimal prediction results. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning are performed to ensure accuracy.

## Results
The final model achieves a predictive accuracy of [XX%] on the testing dataset, highlighting the model's potential for real-world applications in healthcare diagnostics.
